# Demystifying APIs
 
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are essential tools for social work researchers aiming to harness advanced technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI services. This paper demystifies APIs and illustrates how they can enhance research methodologies. It provides an overview of API functionality and integration into research workflows, addressing common barriers for those without programming experience. The paper offers a technical breakdown of code and procedures for using APIs, focusing on connecting to LLMs and leveraging them to facilitate API connections. Practical code examples demonstrate how LLMs can generate API code for accessing specialized services, such as extracting data from unstructured text. Emphasizing data security, privacy considerations, and ethical concerns, the paper highlights the importance of careful data handling when using APIs. By equipping researchers with these tools and knowledge, the paper aims to expand the impact of social work research through the effective incorporation of AI technologies.
